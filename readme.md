# 12 Days of Christmas Challenge

## Summary

I was challenged to write an program which would output the lyrics to the 12 Days of Christmas.  Easy I thought, so 60 seconds later I had it written in C#.

"Not fair" was the cry as you know how to program C#, so the challenge was extended to a language I am unfamiliar with.

Without hesitation it was then extended to -  "I bet you cannot do it in 12 different languages which you have either not used in over 10 years or never used.

So, with the acceptance of the C# initial write - the gaunlet was laid down and I proceeded to do this.

## Timeframe

The timeline is that I must complete it in 4 weeks (so the month of November 2019 is the accepted timeline).

## To the winner go the spoils
The reward for this challenge was not initially decided, I would accept it without any reward.

## Adendum (27/11/2019)
So I finally completed all 12 Days of Christmas and presented this with the following (paraphrased) conversation:

Me:	"Here you go, 12 Days of Christmas in different languages in 4 weeks and I have 3 days to go."

They:	"But alas, you have not completed the 12 Days of Christmas Challenge."

Me:	"?!?  Erm - yes I have, 12 different languages in 4 weeks was the challenge and I still have 3 days remaining."

They:	"Obviously your English skills were below par whence compared to Programming skills, for the challenge was to do it in 12 different languages which you have either not used in over 10 years or never used.  C# is code you write on a daily basis."

Me:	"Bugger!"

They:	"Might I point out that maths was also a weak point."

Me:	"How so?"

They:	"4 weeks * 7 days is 28 days - so you do not have 3 days remaining, you have a little over 25 hours."

Me:	"Double Bugger!"


So about 5 mins ago I was victorious with glistening pride at the challenge which was believed to be completed.  Now I stand deflated as I have to go to work tomorrow and write another version of 12 Days of Christmas.

## Adendum (almost 28/11/2019)

Well - I have completed the challenge..  13 versions of the 12 Days of Christmas written in different languages.

Merry Xmas!
